I will be using the models that we learned about so far in this course. I have chosen the following:
1. Random Forest
2. Support Vector Machines
3. AdaBoost

I will quickly summarize why I didn't choose the other ones:

1. Linear Regression: Does not fit well for data that is non-linear or has many features. In this project, I think this is the case, so I omit this model. 

2. Decision Trees: They tend to overfit. 

3. Naive Baynes: Could probably work, but it is better on text data.

Random Forest
Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.



What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?
What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?
What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?

Support Vector Machines
